Ahh news...

- Autologin (AutomaticLogin key in [daemon] section of gdm.conf)
  This is a string key that if it's set then gdm will log in that
  user without prompting on the first time it runs a local server.
  Will not autologin "root" though as that would be dumb.

- You can have your cursor anywhere while you log in, yay!

- [greeter]/BackgroundProgram thingie.  A program that is run from
  the greeter and killed when the greeter exists.  useful for things
  that do some cool graphics on the root window.

- If greeter keeps segfaulting, it will "unmanage" that display so that you
  can actually log in on a console

- Slave process is actually forked

- Bugfixes galore
