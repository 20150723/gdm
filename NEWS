Ahh news...

2.2.2 stuff:

- When X keeps crashing ask if we should run the X configuration
  (after asking for the root password of course:)

- Fixup shadow and crypt authentication methods

- Fix session directory reading in greeter (Rémi Cohen-Scali)

- Fix the -lwrap and other configure issues

- Better "management" of login screen windows

- The face browser actually work now (Rémi Cohen-Scali, me)

- A clock on the login window (Jonathan, me)

- The language list is now translated

- Accept clicks by the right button as if they are the first button,
  we don't know if the user is left or right handed yet

- Background color seeps through transparent images and allow limitting
  remote logins to only a color backgrounds

- Tooltips on things to make the greeter easier to understand

- AllowConfig now on by default

- Properly runs with a missing gdm.conf

- Remove old failsafe stuff and use the new builtin falisafes, which
  are much nicer

- Saner focus on all gdm windows, and give the failsafe xterm focus

- Gnome and Xsession default sessions now setup xresources and read in
  keymaps

- Default is default if no default was set and it exists (confusing huh? :)

- More Xinerama support (backgrounds, error dialogs, xterm failsafe session)

- Greeter segfault fixed when no lanugage file present

- Anti-hosification meassures.  GDM will now try to do something to allow
  itself to be fixed on some mistakes.  Rather then just aborting and leaving
  crap in the syslog.  And gdmconfig let's you see hosification as it hapens

- Updated fixed icon entry

- Mucho fixes

- Bunch more tooltips on things

- GDM documentation updates

2.2.1 stuff:

- Keyboard navigation in the greeter (Ryan Murray)

- debian build stuff (Ian McKellar)

- Ability to set the background color/pixmap,
  now requires GdkPixbuf because of this.

- The root overlay window is gone now and we have real focus
  management.  In effect gdmlogin is a VERY simple windowmanager.

- Ability to choose a specific GNOME session

- Ability to run the configurator directly on the login screen,
  which requires a root password of course (Disabled by default)

- An editor for the Sessions directory in gdmconfig (Lee)

- Title bar can be hidden by configuration

- The icon entry is now sane with the panel icon entry hack

- If no LANG variable set gdm starts out in the DefaultLocale
  from the config file

- Now non-verbose mode is actually useful and verbose mode
  is still security safe.

- For consistency AllowRoot now works on pam setups as well,
  also a setting just for remote root logins.

- Timed login, you can set up gdm to log in a certain user on the
  first local display after a specified timeout if no one logs in
  (me, Jim Bray)

- Bunch of other fixes (me, Ryan Murray)

- Security fixes, crash fixes and an increase in general paranoia
  (me, Ryan Murray)

- More fault/bad setting tolerant all around

- Translation updates (Christian Meyer, Valek Filippov, Kjartan Maraas,
  Ole Laursen, Jarkko Ranta, Fatih Demir, Stanislav Visnovsky, Martin Norbäck,
  Christian Rose, Yuri Syrota, Christophe Merlet, Pablo Saratxaga, me,
  Ian McKellar)

2.2.0 stuff:

- gdmconfig now works with more fontsizes (me, Lee)

- Another minor xinerama fix

- Fixup the pam message voodoo, so that it now is at least functional even
  though it may not be pretty nor 100% correct.

- Initial gdmconfig documentation (Trevor Curtis, Lee)

- gdmconfig now correctly handles RelaxPerms (Lee)

- gdmconfig has now nice pam console helper setup (Lee)

- gladify/beautify gdmchooser (Lee)

- gdmchooser now apparently works with xdm (Matthias Clasen)

- Better specfile (Gregory Leblanc)

- Packagers should read the comment on end of config/gdm.conf.in (especially
  debian people)

- Configuration file now does not force the adobe version of helvetica, and
  postgres and pvm users are excluded by default (Vlad Hrachev)

- i18n fixes (Gediminas Paulauskas)

- New easter egg

- Bunch of minor fixes

- Translation updates (Yukihiro Nakai, Carlos Perelló Marín, Martin Norbäck,
  Fatih Demir, Simos Xenitellis, Kjartan Maraas, Christian Meyer,
  Christophe Merlet, Stanislav Visnovsky, me)

2.0.99 stuff:

- Cursor set to pointer rather then left as "X"

- Minor login minimize button cleanup (Jonathan Blandford)

- gdmconfig UI update and fixes (Lee Mallabone)

- Easter egg update

- Fixed restarting with HUP when xdmcp is on

- Login and Chooser fixed up for the true/false vs. 1/0 change (Tim Jansen)

- doc updates for true/false vs 1/0 fixups (Tim Jansen)

- Translation updates (Yukihiro Nakai, Christophe Merlet, Gustavo Maciel Dias
  Vieira, Fatih Demir, Simos Xenitellis, Kjartan Maraas, Stanislav Visnovsky,
  Pablo Saratxaga, Jarkko Ranta)

2.0.98.1 stuff:

- a minor Xinerama fix for dialogs

- small XDMCP fix, it apparently works for some people (Matthias Clasen)

- create config files during configure time (Peter Teichman, me)

- Mucho translation updates (Christian Rose, Dan Damian, Simos Xenitellis,
  Szabolcs Ban, Kjartan Maraas, Christophe Merlet, Christian Meyer)

2.0.98 stuff:

- spec file actually works (Lee Mellabone)

- Bigger! Better! Faster!  gdmconfig.  Much cooler and easier to use
  (Lee Mellabone)

- More xinerama fixes (Tim Jansen)

- A bit more xdmcp fixes which still don't make it run

- Bunch of other fixes and cleanups

- New translations (Stanislav Visnovsky, Jarkko Ranta, Valek Filippov,
  Simos Xenitellis)

2.0.97.1 stuff:

- Don't die on non-xinerama supporting display if compiled with xinerama lib

- First cut at a spec file for RedHat 6.x (may work on 7.0 as well maybe)

2.0.97 stuff:

- Graphical configurator in Foot/System/Gdm Confgiurator,
  or run "gdmconfig" (Lee Mellabone)

- i18n and greeter/slave communication fixes (ChiDeok Hwang)

- int vs. bool mess fixed up in the configuration files

- Use the language from the LANG variable as the default and use
  the one from gdm.conf as backup only

- Verbose authentication on by default and don't reveal information
  on verbose authentication.  I may remove this option altogether

- Slower quiver (looks cooler:)

- Reset on main process HUP signal by reexecing self

- Xinerama support for centering the login dialogs (Tim Jansen)

- Mucho fixes to loop of death stuff, race conditions and other such
  fun things

- Translations, fixes etc...
  (Kjartan Maraas, Gediminas Paulasukas, ChiDeok Hwang, Stanislav Visnovsky,
   Valek Filippov, and maybe others)

2.0.96 stuff:

- Multiple local display stuff should now work

- Now autologs in only on the first display

- Bunch of fixes for XDMCP but that still doesn't work, I need
  help here I think

- Local displays are now reset with SIGHUP rather then killed and
  signals are set properly to begin with, this should actually help
  with some buggy X servers I think.

- Login window can be moved (has a titlebar), and this position can be
  set from the config file (not saved however)

- Bunch of cleanup and bugfixes

Open issues:

- XDMCP doesn't work

- Autologin and i18n is not working well (always in english apparently)

2.0.95 stuff:

- Autologin (AutomaticLogin key in [daemon] section of gdm.conf)
  This is a string key that if it's set then gdm will log in that
  user without prompting on the first time it runs a local server.
  Will not autologin "root" though as that would be dumb.

- You can have your cursor anywhere while you log in, yay!

- [greeter]/BackgroundProgram thingie.  A program that is run from
  the greeter and killed when the greeter exists.  useful for things
  that do some cool graphics on the root window.

- If greeter keeps segfaulting, it will "unmanage" that display so that you
  can actually log in on a console

- Slave process is actually forked

- Bugfixes galore
