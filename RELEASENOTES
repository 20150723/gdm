I sort of took over maintaining gdm2, since martin is busy on gdm3.  This is a
temporary state just so that we have a working gdm for 1.4.  And a testbed for
my crazy ideas.

Old notes from Martin:

Indirect choosing was ripped out again. Broke too much and was way too ugly.
I came up with a better design that will definitely go in before 2.0-proper.
Otherwise all opcodes of the XDMCP 1.0 spec are supported.

gdmconfig doesn't work. It's only GUI code so far.
