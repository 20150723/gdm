Indirect choosing was ripped out again. Broke too much and was way too ugly.
I came up with a better design that will definitely go in before 2.0-proper.
Otherwise all opcodes of the XDMCP 1.0 spec are supported.

gdmconfig doesn't work. It's only GUI code so far. 

gdm-manual.txt should be updated and converted to SGML before gdm2 release.

I haven't quite made up my mind whether tab-completion goes back in or not.

gdmlogin should honour user geometry parameters.
