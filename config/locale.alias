# NOTE! This is a broken way to do things.  Gdm currently reads languages ONLY
# from this file.  This is Broken(tm).  This setup will be replaced in some
# future version to be replaced by some automatic detection of available
# locales.  This file is not really a locale.alias file and the first word
# is used as a label in case gdm doesn't know this language personally,
# else it's ignored.
#
# The format of this file is just like the locale.alias file, so you could
# conceivably point gdm at your real locale.alias file if that's a better
# indication of available languages on your system.  Note that the first word
# cannot contain any spaces.
