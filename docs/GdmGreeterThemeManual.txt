========================================

GDM Themes can be created by creating an XML file that follows the
specification in gui/greeter/greeter.dtd.  Theme files are stored
in the following directory

   share/gdm/themes/<theme_name>.

Detailed Description of Theme XML format:

Box Nodes:

  Box nodes are container nodes for item nodes.  Box nodes are
  specified as follows:

  <box orientation="alignment" min-width="int" xpadding="int"
   ypadding="int" spacing="int">

  The alignment value can be either "horizontal" or "vertical".

Item Nodes:

  A GDM Theme is created by specifying a hierarchy of item and box
  nodes.  Item nodes can have the following value for "type":

    entry  - Text entry field
    label  - Label.  Must have a "text" node to specify the text.
    pixmap - Pixmap (in a format GTK+ supports like PNG, JPEG, Tiff)
    rect   - Rectangle
    svg    - Scaled Vector Graphic

  For example:

    <item type="label">

  Items can specify ID values which gives them a specific look
  and feel or formatting:

  entry:

    Entry items can have id values as follows:

       user-pw-entry - Entry field for userid and password entry.

  label:

    Label items can have id values as follows:

     clock         - Label the displays the date and time.
     pam-error     - Label the displays PAM error messages.
     pam-message   - Label the displays PAM message.
     pam-prompt    - Label the displays PAM prompt.
     pam-warning   - Label the displays PAM warning messages.
     timed-label   - Label that displays timed login information

   rect:

     Rectangles can have id values as follows:

       caps-lock-warning - Displays an icon that shows if the
                           CAPS LOCK key is depressed.


     If an item is of type rect, the item can be a button.  Buttons
     must also include a "button" value as follows:

       <item type="rect" id="disconnect_button" button="true">.

     Possible values for button ids are as follows:

       chooser_button    - Runs XDMCP chooser
       config_button     - Only allows configure system
       disconnect_button - Disconnect from remote session
       language_button   - Select language
       halt_button       - Halt system
       reboot_button     - Reboot system
       session_button    - List available sessions
       suspend_button    - Suspect system
       system_button     - Perform halt/reboot/suspend/etc. options
                           (if allowed by gdm configuration).  Also
                           allows user to run configurator if user
                           enters root password (again if allowed
                           by gdm configuration).

Position Node:

  Each item can specify its position and size via the "pos" node.
  For example:

    <pos x="0" y="4" width="100%" height="100%"/>

Show Node:

  Some items may only display in certain modes, like when doing a
  remote display.  Multiple values can be specified and must be
  separated with commas.  The following values are possible:

    console       - In console mode
    console-fixed - In console non-flexi mode
    console-flexi - In console & flexi mode
    flexi         - In flexi mode
    remote        - In remote mode
    remote-flexi  - In remote & flexi mode

  For example:

    <show modes="flexi,remote"/>

  You can also specify the "type" value to indicate that certain
  items should only be displayed if the type is true.  Valid values
  include the following:

    chooser  If ChooserButton is set to "true" in gdm.conf file.
    config   If ConfigAvailable is set to "true" in gdm.conf file.
    halt     If HaltDaemon is specified in gdm.conf file.
    reboot   If RebootCommand is specified in gdm.conf file.
    suspend  If SuspendCommand is specified in gdm.conf file.
    system   If SystemMenu is specified in gdm.conf file
    timed    If TimedLoginEnabled is set to "true" in gdm.conf file.
  
  For example:

    <show modes="console" type="system"/>

Normal/Active/Prelight Nodes:

  Depending on the item type, it can specify its color, font, or
  image via the following tags:

    normal   - normal 
    active   - when the item has active focus
    prelight - when the mouse is hovering over the item

  When item is "rect" (alpha can be omitted and defaults to 0.0):

    <normal color="#fffff" alpha="0.0">

  When item is "label":

    <normal color="#ffffff" font="Sans 14"/>

  When the item type is "pixmap" or "SVG", then the normal, active,
  and prelight tags specify the images to use as follows:

    <normal file="picture.png" tint="#dddddd"/>

  Note that relative pathnames are assumed to be in the same 
  directory as the theme .xml file in share/gdm/themes/<theme_name>.

Text Node:

  Text tags are used by labels.   They can be used to display
  localized text as follows:

    <text xml:lang="fr">Option</text>

Stock:

  Certain common localized labels can be specified via the stock
  tags.  The "text" tag is ignored if the "stock" tag is used.
  The following values are valid:

     caps-lock-warning  _("You've got capslock on!") 
     chooser            _("_XDMCP Chooser")
     disconnect         _("D_isconnect")
     language           _("_Language")
     quit               _("_Quit")
     session            _("_Session")
     system             _("S_ystem")
     timed-label        _("User %s will login in %d seconds")
     username-label     _("Username:")
     welcome-label      _("Welcome to %h")

  For example:

    <stock type="welcome-label"/>
