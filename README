		    GDM - GNOME DISPLAY MANAGER


The Gnome Display Manager is a re-implementation of the well known xdm
program. gdm consists of four separate parts: A small daemon, two
slightly different graphical login programs and a host chooser.

gdm 2.0 implements all significant features required for managing
local and remote displays.

gdm daemon:

 o X Authentication
 o Default and per-display initialization scripts
 o Pre and post session scripts
 o Pluggable Authentication Modules
 o XDMCP
 o TCP Wrappers for access control

gdmgreeter:

 o Logo image (in any GdkImlib supported format)
 o A face browser like the one on NeXT/SGI
 o Tab-completion (no, doesn't work on passwords)
 o Halt, reboot and laptop suspend
 o Iconified login window (i.e. for xfishtank)
 o Session selection support (Package manager friendly)
 o Language selection support

gdmlogin:

 o Logo image
 o Halt and reboot
 o Iconified login window
 o Session selection support
 o Language selection support

gdmchooser:

 o Customizable icons


Most features can be turned on and off in the configuration file by
the sysadmin.
