# GDM Configuration file.  You can use gdmsetup program to graphically
# edit this, or you can optionally just edit this file by hand.  Note that
# gdmsetup does not tweak every option here, just the ones most users
# would care about.  Rest is for special setups and distro specific
# tweaks.  If you edit this file, you should send the HUP or USR1 signal to
# the daemon so that it restarts: (Assuming you have not changed PidFile)
#   kill -USR1 `cat /var/run/gdm.pid`
# (HUP will make gdm restart immediately while USR1 will make gdm not kill
# existing sessions and will only restart gdm after all users log out)
#
# You can also use the gdm-restart and gdm-safe-restart scripts which just
# do the above for you.
