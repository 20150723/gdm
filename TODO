Languages should be read from available locales.  Look at source  for
locale_config.  Currently the way we do things is utter shit.

Old stuff probably irrelevant:
  Finish gdmface.
  Keyboard layout menu.

utmp/wtmp handling.

Allow passwordless login for select users on local screens.  Think kiosk
or public terminal use.

xsri like logo functionality

the photosetup proggie should be put into some sort of crapplet and there
should be other settings in the crapplet as well.

handle all the XFree86 Xserver error thingies, such as
No "Display" subsection for
etc...

Add spacer files.  Files which we can use in case there is disk shortage to
write a new xauthority stuff so that someone can actually log on and clean up.
