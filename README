The Gnome Display Manager is a re-implementation of the well known xdm
program.  GDM implements all significant features required for managing
local and remote displays.

gdm daemon:

 o X Authentication
 o XDMCP (Remote login) including TCP Wrappers for access
   control
 o machine-specific and system-wide configuration support.
 o Default and per-display initialization scripts.
 o PreSession, PostSession, Init, and PostLogin scripts.
 o Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM)
 o IPv6 support (optional, use --enable-ipv6=yes to get this)
 o Autologin for single user workstations (off by default)
 o Timed login for kiosks and public terminals (off by
   default)
 o On demand local servers (gdmflexiserver)
 o SunRay (SRSS) support via gdmdynamic.
 o Can manage X servers without a login window
   (Such as for XDMCP terminal client machines)
 o Many other features ...

gdmlogin and gdmgreeter:
 o Can launch the XDMCP chooser program (remote login)
 o Can launch the Setup program (off by default)
 o Can Halt, reboot, or suspend the machine (off by
   default)
 o Session selection support
 o Language selection support

gdmlogin:

 o Logo image
 o Background image/color
 o Face browser

Reporting Bugs:

  When reporting bugs you should first turn on debugging in
  gdm.conf.  This causes debug messages to be sent to the system
  log (/var/log/messages or /var/adm/messages) and include the
  output sent to syslog.

  You should not have to configure syslog for this to work, but if
  you don't see GDM messages in your syslog you may need to
  configure it.

  You should not leave "debug" on after collecting data.  It will
  clutter your syslog and slow system performance.

Installation:

  Please consult README.install for instructions on how to
  configure and install gdm.

Note:

Originally I started maintaining gdm2 because martin didn't yet finish gdm3 and
was in general busy and we needed a working gdm for 1.4.  The move to gdm3 is
very unlikely to happen now that gdm3 has been pretty dead for quite
a while.  Do not send gdm2 patches to martin (well you can but he'll likely
ignore them:), send them to me instead and I'll integrate them for you.

Note:

Starting January, 2005 I have been acting as maintainer.  Send patches to
me and I will work with you to get them integrated.
