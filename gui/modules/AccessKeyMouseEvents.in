# This is the configuration file for the keymouselistener.so module.
# The confiuration syntax is as follows:
# For keyboard bindings:
# <modifier>[<modifier>...]key	#times duration timeout		full_executable_path +args
# e.g.
# <Control>k	5 1 10		@EXPANDED_BINDIR@/gok
# Means press Contol-k 5 times, holding the keys down for at least 1 second each time
# and with no greater interval than 10 seconds between each event in the sequence
# Completing the sequence will invoke the gnome on screen keyboard program, gok.
# For mouse button bindings the format is the same except the mouse button number
# is specified instead of a keybinding
# <Mouse#>	#times duration timeout		full_executable_path +args
# e.g.
# <Mouse2>	4 3 6		@EXPANDED_BINDIR/gnopernicus
# It is possible to invoke multiple actions from a single binding using the <Add>
# keyword. Each action must be written on a seperate line along with any arguments
# beneath the previous mousebutton or key binding. If none exists the line is ignored.
# e.g.
# <Add>		@EXPANDED_BINDIR/gnome-mag
