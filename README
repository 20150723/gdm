		    GDM - GNOME DISPLAY MANAGER


The Gnome Display Manager is a re-implementation of the well known xdm
program. gdm consists of four separate parts: A small daemon, two
slightly different graphical login programs and a host chooser.

gdm 2.0 implements all significant features required for managing
local and remote displays.

gdm daemon:

 o X Authentication
 o Default and per-display initialization scripts
 o Pre and post session scripts
 o Pluggable Authentication Modules
 o XDMCP
 o TCP Wrappers for access control

gdmlogin:

 o Logo image
 o Halt and reboot
 o Iconified login window
 o Session selection support
 o Language selection support

gdmchooser:

 o Visual host browser 
 o Customizable icons


Most features can be turned on and off in the configuration file by
the sysadmin.

Please consult README.install for instructions on how to configure and
install gdm.

Send suggestions, patches, bug reports etc. to mkp@SunSITE.auc.dk.
Bear in mind that this is beta software and please enable debug
logging (see README.install) and include your syslog and
<vardir>/gdm/<display>.log when sending bug reports.
