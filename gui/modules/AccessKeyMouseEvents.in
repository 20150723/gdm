# This is the configuration file for the keymouselistener.so module.
# The confiuration syntax is as follows:
#
# For keyboard gestures:
#
# <modifier>[<modifier>...]key  #times duration timeout  full_executable_path +args
#
# e.g.
#
# <Control>k  5 1000 10000  @EXPANDED_BINDIR@/gok
#
# Means press Contol-k 5 times, holding each keypress down for at least 1000ms
# each time and with no greater interval than 10000ms between each event in the
# sequence.  A duration value of 0 indicates that a keypress of any length is
# accepted.  The timeout value is only meaningful if the #times value is > 1.
# Completing the above example sequence will invoke the gnome on screen keyboard
# program, gok.
#
# For mouse button gestures the format is the same except the mouse button number
# is specified instead of a key gesture:
#
# <Mouse#>  #times duration timeout  full_executable_path +args
#
# e.g.
#
# <Mouse2>  4 3000 6000  @EXPANDED_BINDIR@/gnopernicus
#
# It is possible to invoke multiple actions from a single gesture using the <Add>
# keyword. Actions specified with <Add> are invoked by the previous gesture
# defined in the file.  If the <Add> action is the first action defined in the
# file, then it is ignored.
#
# e.g.
#
# <Add>  @EXPANDED_BINDIR@/gnome-mag
