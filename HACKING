This package mostly runs as root and is thus security prone, so be careful
about changes.  Ask me (Brian.Cameron@sun.com) if you have questions.  It's
probably better to ask before committing though we won't gnaw your head off
if you don't (unless you break something in which case we'll get medieval
on you :).  However we're never opposed to people hacking on this and fixing
things and adding features.  So have fun.
