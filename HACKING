This package is now actively maintained by me so mail me if you change
something big.  If you have a fix or a small change, just go for it and
commit and I'll flame you later if I didn't like the change.

old HACKING:


This package is actively developed and maintained.

Don't commit changes without asking mkp@mkp.net first unless you are
doing translation stuff.
